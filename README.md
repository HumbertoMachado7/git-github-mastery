## How to Run the Code

You can run these JavaScript files using Node.js:

1.  Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2.  Clone this repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/HumbertoMachado7/javascript-fundamentals-exercises.git`
3.  Navigate into the repository directory:
    `cd javascript-fundamentals-exercises`
4.  Run any exercise file using `node` (e.g., run `node 01valores.js`). For files that might require a web browser environment, you'd need to adapt (or mention it in the README).
5.  If any files have dependencies listed in `package.json`, run `npm install` first.
6.  To run test files (ending in `.test.js`), you typically need a test runner like Jest or Mocha and a command like `npm test` (if configured in `package.json`).
